# Generate-SPPU-Tech-Quiz

This repository contains LangFlow flows that generate SPPU multiple-choice quizzes (MCQs) from subject content stored in Astra DB → https://astra.datastax.com

# Quiz Generator with LangFlow

Create auto-generated multiple-choice quizzes (MCQs) based on SPPU syllabus content using a no-code/low-code GenAI pipeline in LangFlow.

# 🎯 Project Goal

Build a GenAI pipeline that:

- Ingests SPPU subject notes, question banks, or textbooks into Astra DB  
- Retrieves relevant unit-wise content  
- Generates validated multiple-choice quiz questions with correct answers  

# Key Features

- Syllabus-driven quiz generation → Questions come directly from SPPU content  
- Unit-wise selection → Generate quizzes for any Unit (I–VI)  
- Configurable question count → Decide how many questions you want  
- Exam-oriented → Matches SPPU question patterns  
- Extendable → Replace SPPU subject with any other topic  

# Architecture (Flow Overview)

**Ingest Flow (quiz_ingest.json)**  
SPPU Content → Split Text → Astra DB (storage)  

**Retrieve Flow (quiz_retrieve.json)**  
Chat Input → Astra DB → Parser → Prompt Template → Groq LLM → Chat Output  

# Components Used in LangFlow

- **Input:** User’s subject text or quiz request  
- **Astra DB:** Stores SPPU content chunks  
- **Parser:** Enforces schema & structure  
- **Prompt Template:** Custom instructions to generate MCQs  
- **LLM:** Groq (can be swapped with other LLMs)  
- **Output:** Display quiz with answers  

# Tech Stack

- LangFlow (flow orchestration)  
- Astra DB (vector DB for context storage & retrieval)  
- Groq LLM (for question generation)  
- Python 3.12.1
